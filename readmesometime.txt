This is Tim Johnson's newLISP emacs mode.  I have made a few small customizations to suite it more for me:
	 1. Changed the symbol color from magenta to plum.  I hate magenta.
	 2. Updated with symbols from 9.3.3
	 3. Added `C-x e` as binding to evaluate current list and move to the next (tuareg-style.)
	 4. Fixed a couple of invalid parameter lists in let bindings that were keeping newlisp.el from byte-compiling
