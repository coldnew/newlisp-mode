Note that I just found this code somewhere, got it to work and am documenting
what I've found and any fixes/improvements I make here in case someone else
finds them useful.

The following elisp code in my .emacs or init.el works for me.

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/newlisp-mode")
(load-file "~/newlisp-mode/newlisp.el")
;(require 'newlisp-mode)
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.lsp$" . newlisp-mode))
;(autoload 'newlisp "newlisp" "Major mode for newlisp files" t)
(eval-after-load "speedbar" '(speedbar-add-supported-extension ".lsp"))
